      "I wanted to add special effects and animation to my MySpace website back in middle school (scrolling marquee, embedded music player, and falling snowballs ... you know, all the cheesy stuff). After that, I created my very first website on Expage with the help of Google. I didn't know at the time that I was coding and had no idea that coding can be a career choice. Fast forward 15 years later, I'm living in Seattle and decided to attend a Girls Who Code meetup to learn SQL and ended up learning about LaunchCode, a free seven month coding bootcamp. I applied for the program and got accepted and thus began my coding journey!",
